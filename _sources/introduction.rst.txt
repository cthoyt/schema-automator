LinkML Schema Automator
=======================

This is a toolkit that assists with:

1. Bootstrapping LinkML models from instance data

   -  TSVs and spreadsheets
   -  SQLite databases
   -  RDF instance graphs

2. Bootstrapping a LinkML model from a different schema representation
   (i.e.Â opposite of a linkml.generator)

   -  OWL (RDFS-like subset)
   -  TODO: JSON-Schema, XSD, ShEx, SHACL, SQL DDL, FHIR, Python
      dataclasses/pydantic, etc

3. Using automated methods to enhance a model

   -  Using text mining and concept annotator APIs to enrich semantic
      enums
   -  TODO: querying sparql endpoints to retrieve additional metadata

These can be composed together. For example, run ``tsvs2linkml``
followed by ``annotate-enums``

The toolkit is still experimental. It is intended as an aid to schema
creation rather than act as a formal conversion tool
